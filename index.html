      You've probably heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcatcher">dream catchers.</a> You may
      even have one or seen one hanging from a tree branch or on a wall. But I bet there's a lot about dream catchers
      that you probably don't know. Let's explore their origins, legends and how they're used today.People mostly use
      them for decoration today but dream catchers have a long history among First Nations people. They were given to
      children to hang over their beds to ward off bad dreams.

    <h2>What is a dream catcher?</h2><br />

    <br /><br />
    <h2>Where did dream catchers come from?</h2>
    <p>
      Explorers reported that the Ojibwa people were using dream catchers to protect children while they slept they
      were sometimes called "Sacred Hoops." Dream catchers have also been used by Cree and other First Nations
      people.One legend tells the story of a chief whose child becomes sick with a fever that causes terrible
      nightmares. A medicine woman makes a dream catcher by copying the pattern of a spider web. Instead of
      catching flies, the dream catcher will catch bad dreams.

    <br />
    <p>
      When nightmares came for the child, they were caught in the strands of sinew. But good dreams were able to
      pass through the web and follow the feather down to the child. In the morning, the sun would hit the dream
      catcher and burn away the bad dreams.

    <br />
    <h2 align="center">Story behind Dream Catchers</h2>
    <center><img alt="sunset View through dream catchers " src="images/story.jpg" /></center>
    <p>The Ojibwa (Chippewa) believe that night is full of both good and bad dreams. When a dream catcher is hung
      above
      the place where you sleep it moves freely in the night air and catches the dreams as they drift by. The good
      dreams, knowing their way, pass through the opening in the center of the webbing while the bad dreams, not
      knowing
      the way, are caught in thâˆ«e webbing and destroyed at the first light of the morning sun.
      There are many variants to the dream catcher legend, some which say both the good and bad dreams are captured
      and
      some which say the good dreams slide down the feather to those sleeping below. Although the Ojibwa are credited
      as
      the first people to use Dream Catchers many other Tribes and Native peoples have adopted Dream Catchers into
      their
      culture. Even though the designs and legends of Dream Catchers differ slightly, the underlying meaning and
      symbolism is universal and is carried across cultures and language barriers.</p>
